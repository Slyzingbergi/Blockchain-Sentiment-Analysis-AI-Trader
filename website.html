        <h2>A new innovative way of trading crypto</h2>
        <hr class="bottom">
        <p>HackED, <span id="date">Jan. 28 </span>&mdash;The markets of cryptocurrency are controlled entirely by the speculative masses. As news, either positive or negative is released, hundreds of billions of dollars (millions of Bitcoin) are created and lost day to day. With such a fast moving market it is important to be on top of not only the technology behind the movement of these markets, but also the people behind it all.</p>
        <p>Block Sentiment Chain uses the cutting edge of technology to analyze the sources of news that are behind the rise and fall of Crypto Currencies. Scraping important data from a carefully selected list of news sources, BSC gathers sentiment data and provides a whole new direction from which to analyze the markets. With an emphasis on early price change recognitions, BSC will give you the opportunity to beat the market.</p>
